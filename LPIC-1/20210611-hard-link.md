Hard link is [the link is between the filename and the actual data stored on the filesystem](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linking-linux-explained)

## inode number

Each file and directory in the system has an inode number. If some files have the same inode number, they are the same file.

Consider we have a directory structure as below

```
$ tree inode001/
inode001/
├── file4
└── file5
```

Use `ls -li` to show inode number (`-i` for inode)

```
$ ls -li inode001/
total 0
17852811 -rw-rw-r--. 1 pqa pqa 0 Jun 12 05:28 file4
17852815 -rw-rw-r--. 1 pqa pqa 0 Jun 12 05:28 file5
```

Also we can see there is `1` hard link count of each file. 

Create a hard link from `file4` to another file

```
$ ln inode001/file4 inode001/file4-linked
```

Now see the inode number of `file4` and the file hard-linked to it.

```
$ ls -li inode001/
total 0
17852811 -rw-rw-r--. 2 pqa pqa 0 Jun 12 05:28 file4
17852811 -rw-rw-r--. 2 pqa pqa 0 Jun 12 05:28 file4-linked
17852815 -rw-rw-r--. 1 pqa pqa 0 Jun 12 05:28 file5
```

They have the same inode number `17852811`, they are the same file, they are pointing to the same data. Also, the hard link count of `file4` has become `2`.

Editing `file4` will also reflect on `file4-linked`

```
$ echo hello world >> inode001/file4
$ cat inode001/file4
hello world
$ cat inode001/file4-linked 
hello world
```

## Hard link count: how many sub-directories in a directory

Let's look at an empty directory.

```
$ ls -la dir0002/
total 0
drwxrwxr-x. 2 pqa pqa  6 Jun 12 07:22 .
drwxrwxr-x. 6 pqa pqa 74 Jun 12 07:22 ..
```

Inside every directory, there are always 2 hard links. One is to the directory itself, displayed as `.`. The other is to its parent, displayed as `..`.

Because every directory has a hard link to its parent directory, the hard link count of a directory tells how many sub-directories inside it.

Consider we have a directory structure like this

```
$ tree
.
└── hardlink
    ├── d1
    │   ├── file6
    │   └── file7
    ├── d2
    │   ├── file6
    │   └── file7
    ├── d3
    │   ├── file6
    │   └── file7
    ├── d4
    │   ├── file6
    │   └── file7
    └── d5
        ├── file6
        └── file7
```

Let's check the hard link count of `hardlink` directory

```
$ ls -ld hardlink/
drwxrwxr-x. 7 pqa pqa 71 Jun 12 04:50 hardlink/
```

It's 7 hard links, means there are 7 directories inside it. They are `d1` ~ `d5`, the `.` as current directory (`hardlink`), and `..` as the parent directory.

We can see them all if we `ls -aF`

```
$ ls -aF hardlink/
./  ../  d1/  d2/  d3/  d4/  d5/  file001
```

We can count that there are 7 directories (which end with a `/`) in total.

## Soft link

Soft links are known as symbolic links.

Why do we need a soft link?
- See `Hard limits` here: https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linking-linux-explained

`ln -s`: Create a soft link

```
$ sudo ln -s $(which yum) yum-link
$ ls -li yum-link
35250605 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 12 Jun 12 22:00 yum-link -> /usr/bin/yum
$ ls -liF /usr/bin/yum
16912089 -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 801 Oct  1  2020 /usr/bin/yum*
```
